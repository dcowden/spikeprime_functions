Functions and Utilities for SpikePrime

The documented api provided by spikeprime is terrible. There are lots of limitations:

 * You can't call async methods: really hard to do more than one thing at once
 * Bluetooth is unreliable, especially when printing 
 * the provided app is bad ( cant copy and paste)
 * cant create your own modules to factor code
 * No support for unit testing 
 * No logging facility other than print statements
 * No documentation for the underlying, native api
 * No support for broadcasts
 *
